| ------| ------| 
| Description | A 3D game in a large environment where 2 robbers come into a house where the kid is alone. The kid has to hide from the robbers and has to set a prank for them to terrify them.|
| My Role: | As a Software Engineer, I worked on multiple levels of development, animations, timelines, VFX, and SFX. While completing the project, I was working to make game aesthetics look more catchy and engaging to the users while also helping the team to come up with various pranks that can be added to the game to engage users.  |
